# @gungkrisna/react-native-ios-time-picker

An iOS-style picker component inspired by Swift [UIDatePicker](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker)'s countDownTimer mode without the native side. Working cross-platform and compatible with Expo. It's a fork of [react-native-wheel-picker](https://github.com/quidone/react-native-wheel-picker).
